Script Refactor for presentation at Yegsec/EdmontonPy Smash-up

The original: https://github.com/mspaling/mbam-exclusions-poc-/blob/master/mbam-whitelist-poc.txt

A demonstration of readability and some small improvements that can be made with linting,
splitting into functions, using constants, f-strings, and preference docstrinsg over comments.
Also swapped to Py3 as the changes were minimal.

Packages used for linting and formatting:

- isort
- flake8
- flake8-isort
- black
